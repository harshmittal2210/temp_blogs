Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

I have been using Git since my college projects and have helped me to organize my projects and resolve a lot of bugs. Through this blog, I will try to explain the basic concept of git that has helped me.

## Install Git

To install in **Linux**: 

```bash
$ sudo apt install git
```

To install in **Windows**:

Download the [Windows Git Intaller](https://gitforwindows.org/)

To install in **Mac**:

Download the [Mac Git Intaller](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/)

### Verify Git Installation

Run:

```bash
$ git --version
```

Output:

```bash
git version <version_name>
```

### Configure your Git

Before using git you need to configure it properly. 

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Harsh Mittal"
$ git config --global user.email "harshmittal2210@gmail.com"
```

## Basic Commands

- To **initialize git** in a folder:

```bash
git init
```

- **Add Origin** (Push an existing folder)

```bash
git remote add origin <link.git>

## Example:
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshmittal2210/youtubeProjects.git
```

- **Clone Repository** (If repo is already created)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshmittal2210/youtubeProjects
```

- **Add Files** to update what will be committed:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also add everything by using:

```bash
git add .
# or
git add --all
```

- **Commit Changes**:

```bash
git commit -m "<Commit Message>"
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To commit changes with description:

```bash
git commit
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will open up a text editor (customizable via `git config`) asking for a commit log message, along with a list of whatâ€™s being committed:

```bash
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
# (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage)
#
#modified: Readme.md
```

- **Push Commits to Repository**:

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>

## Example
git push origin master
```

- **New Branch**:

```bash
git branch dev && git checkout dev
## OR
git checkout -b dev
```

- **Change Branch**:

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>

## Example
git checkout dev
```

## Playing with Origins

In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from. More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository's URL - and thereby makes referencing much easier.

- **Add Multiple Origins**

```bash
git remote add <origin_name> <repo_link>

## Example
git remote add origin https://github.com/harshmittal2210/youtubeProjects.git
git remote add diff_origin https://github.com/harshmittal2210/mulitCopyPaste.git
```

- **Change Existing Git origin URL**

```bash
git remote set-url origin <new_link>
```

## Git Submodules

Submodules are used when you want to use any other library within your project. It is used in such cases where you want to use both of them while keeping them separate.

- **Add Submodule**:

```bash
git submodule add <Repo_Link>

## Example
git submodule add https://github.com/harshmittal2210/mulitCopyPaste.git
```

- **Update All Submodule**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is used when you have cloned a project and you want to update all the submodules as well.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Review Pull Request (PR)

Let's say you are working on a really big project with multiple developers. One of the developers creates a PR and you have to review it.
To run the code you need to have it in your system and since it is not yet merged you cannot directly access it using a simple git pull.

The way that I prefer is using git fetch and checkout the pull request in headless mode so that unnecessary local branches are not created.

```bash 
git fetch upstream pull/<ID>/head && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
```

Here ID is the PR ID that you can see on the pull request page.


## Stash

`git stash` saves all the changes you have made temporarily so that you can do some other work and come back to those changes and apply it.

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Changes to be committed:

    new file:   test.py

Changes not staged for commit:

    modified:   Readme.md

$ git stash

Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 7003d57 our new homepage
HEAD is now at 7003d57 our new homepage

$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Bring back the stash:

- Apply and remove from stash

```bash
git stash pop
```
- Apply and keep in stash

```bash
git stash apply
```
